# [How NFT Will Change The World](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/how-nft-will-change-content-world)

I am an NFT enthusiast. I found this article interesting because it explains the concept of NFT very well. I am very positive that NFT will change the usage of the digital asset completely in the future. Using an NFT technology, users will be able to prove their ownership. NFT has so much potential that it can really be used anywhere in the world. The trend is currently changing that I believe NFT boom will dominate the world in 2 - 3 years. :) I hope some classmates become a huge fan of NFT after reading the article. Feel free to ask me any questions about the NFT!
